A resource I found incredibly insightful for not only physics olympiad preparation but also the way we should approach learning in general was Kevin Zhou's remarkable [Advice Handout](https://knzhou.github.io/writing/Advice.pdf).

Clearly, his writing is far more detailed than what's needed for an article on this site&mdash;even just a few thoughful, contributing sentences is enough&mdash;but it gives an example of the kind of content that can be included and the impact an article should aim for.
